# Crypto Playground
The building blocks of a cryptocurrency tool for managing real-time crypto exchange data. Engineered in a microservices architecture by incorporating a seperate client side, backend layer and script dependencies. 

## Development and Testing Environment
This build focuses on the client side of the application. 
* Currently using React (w/ yarn) to layout the GUI design 
* Using node.js/express.js to handle the websocket connection 
* Will look to move the middleware to it's a standalone environment
